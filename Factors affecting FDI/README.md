FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between various factors, such as the labor force, economic freedom index, and gross domestic product (GDP), and their impact on the inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country.

Foreign direct investment entails investments made by foreign entities, including individuals or corporations, in a country's economy. These investments may take different forms, such as establishing factories or acquiring ownership of local businesses.

The project aims to investigate how factors like labor force availability and skills, economic freedom index, and GDP affect the inflow of FDI into the country. This examination can help identify specific aspects of the country's economy that may attract or deter foreign investors, thus informing policy decisions aimed at boosting FDI inflows.

Increased FDI inflows offer potential benefits such as more employment opportunities, enhanced economic growth, and technological advancements in the country. Consequently, the findings of this study could play a crucial role in shaping policy decisions geared toward enhancing the country's economic performance and overall prosperity.
